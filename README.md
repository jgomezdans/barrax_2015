# Material for the NERC STFC Field Spectroscopy Course
## Radiative Transfer theory and model inversion

### J Gomez-Dans (NCEO & UCL) `<j.gomez-dans@ucl.ac.uk>`

This repository contains a number of presentations and practicals used in the 
NERC funded Field Spectroscopy Course that took place in Albacete (Spain) in
July 2015. The presentations can be viewed as HTML files witin the browser, or
you can also peruse the original IPython notebooks that were used to create
them.

The practicals are in the form of IPython notebooks. Currently, they require 
you to have access to a computer that runs Linux, and to have several different
packages installed. If you don't have access to this, you can also use a 
VirtualBox image with all the required packages installed.

##### Presentations

You can find the following presentations:

* A motivation for RT modelling [(slides)[http://jgomezdans.github.io/barrax_2015/RTMotivation.slides.html]][(IPython notebook)[http://github.io/jgomezdans/barrax_2015/RTMotivation.ipynb]]
