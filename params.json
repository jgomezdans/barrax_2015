The presentations can be viewed as HTML files witin the browser, or\r\nyou can also peruse the original IPython notebooks that were used to create\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nThe practicals are in the form of IPython notebooks. Currently, they require \r\nyou to have access to a computer that runs Linux, and to have several different\r\npackages installed. If you don't have access to this, you can also use a \r\nVirtualBox image with all the required packages installed.\r\n\r\n##### Presentations\r\n\r\nYou can find the following presentations:\r\n\r\n* A motivation for RT modelling [[slides](http://jgomezdans.github.io/barrax_2015/RTMotivation.slides.html)][[IPython notebook](http://github.io/jgomezdans/barrax_2015/RTMotivation.ipynb)]\r\n* A brief introduction to leaf RT models [[slides](http://jgomezdans.github.io/barrax_2015/LeavesRTpres.slides.html)][[IPython notebook](http://github.io/jgomezdans/barrax_2015/LeavesRTpres.ipynb)]\r\n* An introduction to canopy RT models [[slides](http://jgomezdans.github.io/barrax_2015/CanopyRTpres.slides.html)][[IPython notebook](http://github.io/jgomezdans/barrax_2015/CanopyRTpres.ipynb)]\r\n* An introduction to RT model inversion [[slides](http://jgomezdans.github.io/barrax_2015/InversionPres.slides.html)][[IPython notebook](http://github.io/jgomezdans/barrax_2015/InversionPres.ipynb)]\r\n\r\n##### Tutorials\r\n\r\nYou can also find a number of tutorials. These are \r\n\r\n* A lab session on the PROSPECT leaf RT model [[IPython notebook]\r\n(http://github.io/jgomezdans/barrax_2015/leaf_optics.ipynb)] [[HTML](http://jgomezdans.github.io/barrax_2015/leaf_optics.html)]\r\n* A lab session on the SAIL (and PROSPECT) RT model [[IPython notebook](http://github.io/jgomezdans/barrax_2015/PROSAIL_experiments.ipynb)] [[HTML](http://jgomezdans.github.io/barrax_2015/PROSAIL_experiments.html)]\r\n\r\n##### Installing the VirtualBox Image\r\n\r\nThe practicals are written in Python using the IPython notebook. \r\nWhile in principle this is a portable solution, compiling the PROSAIL model \r\nPython bindings has proven challenging on some systems, so we provide a \r\nVirtual Box Linux image that you can install on your computer and use to\r\nrun the contents of the course. \r\n\r\nThe [Virtual Box file is here](http://www.geog.ucl.ac.uk/ucl-vm), but mind\r\nyou: **it is a 4.4Gb file**. You will need to download the [VirtualBox software](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads)\r\nfor your computer, and install the appliance. Note that you will need a\r\nfairly modern computer to use the VBox comfortably: ideally more than \r\n4Gb of RAM.\r\n","google":"UA-25702318-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
